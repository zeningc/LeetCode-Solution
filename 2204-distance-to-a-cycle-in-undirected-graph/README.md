<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/distance-to-a-cycle-in-undirected-graph/">2204. Distance to a Cycle in Undirected Graph</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><div><p>You are given a positive integer <code>n</code> representing the number of nodes in a <strong>connected undirected graph</strong> containing <strong>exactly one</strong> cycle. The nodes are numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>).</p>

<p>You are also given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [node1<sub>i</sub>, node2<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there is a <strong>bidirectional</strong> edge connecting <code>node1<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>node2<sub>i</sub></code> in the graph.</p>

<p>The distance between two nodes <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> is defined to be the <strong>minimum</strong> number of edges that are needed to go from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>an integer array <code>answer</code></em><em> of size </em><code>n</code><em>, where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is the <strong>minimum</strong> distance between the </em><code>i<sup>th</sup></code><em> node and <strong>any</strong> node in the cycle.</em></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[0,1],[5,2],[6,5]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,0,0,0,0,1,2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 form the cycle.
The distance from 0 to 1 is 1.
