<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profitable-triplets-with-increasing-prices-i/">2907. Maximum Profitable Triplets With Increasing Prices I</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given the <strong>0-indexed</strong> arrays <code>prices</code> and <code>profits</code> of length <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> items in an store where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item has a price of <code>prices[i]</code> and a profit of <code>profits[i]</code>.</p>

<p>We have to pick three items with the following condition:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>prices[i] &lt; prices[j] &lt; prices[k]</code> where <code>i &lt; j &lt; k</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we pick items with indices <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> satisfying the above condition, the profit would be <code>profits[i] + profits[j] + profits[k]</code>.</p>

<p>Return<em> the <strong>maximum profit</strong> we can get, and </em><code>-1</code><em> if it's not possible to pick three items with the given condition.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [10,2,3,4], profits = [100,2,7,10]
<strong>Output:</strong> 19
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can't pick the item with index i=0 since there are no indices j and k such that the condition holds.
So the only triplet we can pick, are the items with indices 1, 2 and 3 and it's a valid pick since prices[1] &lt; prices[2] &lt; prices[3].
The answer would be sum of their profits which is 2 + 7 + 10 = 19.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [1,2,3,4,5], profits = [1,5,3,4,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> 15
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can select any triplet of items since for each triplet of indices i, j and k such that i &lt; j &lt; k, the condition holds.
Therefore the maximum profit we can get would be the 3 most profitable items which are indices 1, 3 and 4.
The answer would be sum of their profits which is 5 + 4 + 6 = 15.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [4,3,2,1], profits = [33,20,19,87]
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can't select any triplet of indices such that the condition holds, so we return -1.

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>3 &lt;= prices.length == profits.length &lt;= 2000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= profits[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code></li>
</ul>
